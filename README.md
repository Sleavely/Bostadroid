About
=====

Bostadroid is a mobile application meant to provide the same functionality as the [Public Apartment Rental Queue of Stockholm](http://www.bostad.stockholm.se/en/ "Stockholms Stads Bostadsförmedling").
This repo contains the frontend, which can be found on the [Android Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.sleavely.bostadroid) (and - hopefully - soon on the App Store).

Roadmap
=======

* add language support
* hide google map while loading
* "loading" only shows when swiping, not when loading house via list
* add remaining listing statuses (retiree home, first come first serve, etc)
* add button for clearing login data properly
* news section
* jQuery Mobile 1.0

I know I should try out the Issues tab for most of this :(
