Bostadroid is a mobile application meant to provide the same functionality as the [Public Apartment Rental Queue of Stockholm](http://www.bostad.stockholm.se/en/ "Stockholms Stads Bostadsförmedling").
This repo contains the frontend, which can be found on the [Android Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.sleavely.bostadroid) (and - hopefully - soon on the App Store).
