Roadmap
=======

* add language support
* hide google map while loading
* "loading" only shows when swiping, not when loading house via list
* add remaining listing statuses (retiree home, first come first serve, etc)
* add button for clearing login data properly
* news section
* jQuery Mobile 1.0

I know I should try out the Issues tab for most of this :(
